An  increasing development in the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies offer countless opportunities to reinvent our surroundings, where intelligence and efficiency are key concepts in the creation of new products. Even the most basic devices, that currently work in isolation, will become part of a complex integrated system, and information exchange will be an integral requirement for operation. The establishment of a solid communication infrastructure is a vital part of the process and, in conjunction with the application of such technologies, it brings modern concepts, such as Smart Homes and Smart Cities, and offers a new paradigm responsible for the modernization of urban living.

Based on the previous scenario, this work aims to provide a complete system for Smart Houses. It explores communication technologies and connectivity between devices, with an accessible and expandable platform for residencies automation, and low cost production.

Microcontroller circuits, in addition to actuators, sensors  and radio transmitters, are vastly used on the hardware modules. The creation of a messaging exchange protocol, and the use of a publisher/subscriber messaging broker, all controlled by a server, composes the local communication infrastructure. The user interacts with the system through a web client, powered by cloud microservices, which are connected via WebSockets to the home.

All of the prototypes developed proved to be viable and functional, fulfilling the specified requirements and passing performed tests. With hope, this initiative will be continued and further improved on top of this underlying foundation.
